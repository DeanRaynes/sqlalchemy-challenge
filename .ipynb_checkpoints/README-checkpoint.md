# sqlalchemy-challenge

This repository is for the sqlalchemy challenge, the code in the jupyter notebook should be able to access the sqlite database, and then has some queries to ask the data some questions about the precipitation data.  Then it is turned into a dataframe using pandas to plot a few graphs.  This repository also includes an app that is ran using Flask.  This app allows users to look at the last 12 months of data for the most active weather station in Hawaii.  There is a URL setup to allow users to input dates to choose the date filter with which to see the data from the station.
